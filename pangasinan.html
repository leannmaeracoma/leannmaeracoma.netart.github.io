	<p>My name is Helen V. Halog. I was borned and raised in San Fabian. My family was rich. We had a house, land for farming, and my siblings and I went to school. However, my brothers wanted to go to America. They saw opportunities. I didn't. I want to be a teacher and teach at the school in front of my house. But my brothers want us all to go to America. </p>
	<h3>Go to America</h3>
	<h3>Stay here</h3>
