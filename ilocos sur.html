	<p>My name is Leonardo T. Racoma. I was borned and raised in Vigan. My family lives in a small house near the river. I love the water, always want to be near it. I also love to paint. If I could, I would go to school for it. My father passed away and I don't know what to do with my life. What should I do? </p>
